# GeoLab

This repository release the source-code from "Geolab : Geometric-based  tractography parcellation of Superficial white matter" accepted by the ISBI 2023.
It also makes available the altas used in the article.

GeoLab is a tool for superficial white matter parcellation, which improves the RecoBundles framework (made for deep white matter parcellation) to work on superficial white matter. This method outperforms the SOTAs on semi-ground truth (ARCHI dataset) and has a comparable result on the UKBiobank dataset.
